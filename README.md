# Express War Game

a card war game built using `express` and Node.js, there is two players `player1` and `player2` which is me:

- Any one can play, see [my github profile](https://github.com/malkiii)
- Each one has random 26 cards.
- the game ends when we run out of cards and the one with the highest score wins.
- Click on ðŸ‘† pile to play.
